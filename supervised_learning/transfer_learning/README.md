# 🧠 Transfer Learning with CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Project Overview
I built a high-performance image classifier using transfer learning techniques, achieving 94.48% validation accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project demonstrates the power of transfer learning combined with careful optimization and architectural decisions.

## ✨ Key Features
- Transfer learning implementation using pre-trained Keras model
- Advanced regularization with spatial dropout
- Custom learning rate scheduling with linear decay
- Comprehensive data augmentation pipeline
- Multiple model versions with progressive improvements
- Experimental visualization techniques

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
I experimented with several architectural variants, with the final model incorporating:
- Pre-trained base model from Keras Applications
- Custom top model with attention mechanisms
- Spatial dropout for improved regularization
- 7x7 kernel configurations for enhanced feature extraction
- Class-weighted learning to handle imbalanced data

## Training Process
My training approach incorporates several optimization strategies:
- Progressive learning rate adjustment with linear decay
- Multiple data augmentation schemes
- Balanced mini-batch sampling
- Validation-based model checkpointing
- Various dropout configurations (20-75%) for optimal regularization

## 📊 Results
- Final Validation Accuracy: 94.48%
- Tracked multiple metrics:
  - Class-specific accuracy
  - Confusion matrix analysis
  - Training history visualization
  - Preprocessing effectiveness comparisons
